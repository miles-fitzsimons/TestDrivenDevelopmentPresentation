# TestDrivenDevelopmentPresentation

This my my 2018 Unconference presentation entitled "Test-driven development: A hands-on 101".

I intend to run the presentation entirely from within VSCode. The 'slides' are the HTML/CSS pages in the `presentation` folder.

I am using [VSCode Browser Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasonlhy.vscode-browser-sync) to serve the static HTML pages in VSCode. To get it running, install that extension, go to an HTML page in VSCode, `ctrl + shift + p` and search for `Browser Sync: Server mode at side panel` (just hit `enter` in the relative-path pop-up).
